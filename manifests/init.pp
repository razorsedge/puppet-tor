# == Class: tor
#
# This class handles installing the Tor onion router.
# https://www.torproject.org/
# Default configuration is to be a tor client.
#
# === Parameters:
#
# [*socksport*]
#   Open this port to listen for connections from SOCKS-speaking applications.
#   Default: 127.0.0.1:9050
#
# [*sockspolicy*]
#   Set an entrance policy for this server, to limit who can connect to the
#   SocksPort.
#   Default: accept *:*
#
# [*orport*]
#   Advertise this port to listen for connections from Tor clients and servers.
#   This option is required to be a Tor server.
#   Default: 0
#
# [*address*]
#   The IP address or fully qualified domain name of this server. You can leave
#   this unset, and Tor will guess your IP address. This IP address is the one
#   used to tell clients and other servers where to find your Tor server; it
#   doesn’t affect the IP that your Tor client binds to.
#   Default: none
#
# [*outboundbindaddress*]
#   Make all outbound connections originate from the IP address specified. This
#   is only useful when you have multiple network interfaces, and you want all
#   of Tor’s outgoing connections to use a single one.
#   Default: none
#
# [*nickname*]
#   Set the server’s nickname to 'name'. Nicknames must be between 1 and 19
#   characters inclusive, and must contain only the characters [a-zA-Z0-9].
#   Default: none
#
# [*myfamily*]
#   Declare that this Tor server is controlled or administered by a group or
#   organization identical or similar to that of the other servers, defined by
#   their identity fingerprints or nicknames.
#   Default: none
#
# [*bandwidthrate*]
#   A token bucket limits the average incoming bandwidth usage on this node to
#   the specified number of bytes per second, and the average outgoing
#   bandwidth usage to that same value.
#   Default: 5 MB
#
# [*bandwidthburst*]
#   Limit the maximum token bucket size (also known as the burst) to the given
#   number of bytes in each direction.
#   Default: 10 MB
#
# [*numcpus*]
#   How many processes to use at once for decrypting onionskins and other
#   parallelizable operations.
#   Default: 0 (autodetect)
#
# [*contactinfo*]
#   Administrative contact information for server.
#   Default: none
#
# [*dirport*]
#   If this option is nonzero, advertise the directory service on this port.
#   Default: 0
#
# [*exitpolicy*]
#   Set an exit policy for this server.
#   Default: reject *:25,reject *:119,reject *:135-139,reject *:445,
#            reject *:563,reject *:1214,reject *:4661-4666,reject *:6346-6429,
#            reject *:6699,reject *:6881-6999,accept *:*
#
# [*yum_server*]
#   The URL for the YUM server host.
#   Default: http://deb.torproject.org
#
# [*yum_path*]
#   The URL path.
#   Default: /torproject.org/rpm
#
# [*yum_priority*]
#   The priority that the Tor YUM repos will have.
#   Default: 50
#
# [*yum_protect*]
#   Whether to protect this YUM repo.
#   Default: 0
#
# [*ensure*]
#   Ensure if present or absent.
#   Default: present
#
# [*autoupgrade*]
#   Upgrade package automatically, if there is a newer version.
#   Default: false
#
# [*package_name*]
#   Name of the package.
#   Only set this if your platform is not supported or you know what you are
#   doing.
#   Default: auto-set, platform specific
#
# [*file_name*]
#   Name of the client config file.
#   Only set this if your platform is not supported or you know what you are
#   doing.
#   Default: auto-set, platform specific
#
# [*service_ensure*]
#   Ensure if service is running or stopped.
#   Default: running
#
# [*service_name*]
#   Name of the service
#   Only set this if your platform is not supported or you know what you are
#   doing.
#   Default: auto-set, platform specific
#
# [*service_enable*]
#   Start service at boot.
#   Default: false
#
# [*service_hasrestart*]
#   Service has restart command.
#   Default: true
#
# [*service_hasstatus*]
#   Service has status command.
#   Only set this if your platform is not supported or you know what you are
#   doing.
#   Default: true
#
# === Actions:
#
# Installs the tor package.
# Manages the torrc file.
# Starts the tor service.
#
# === Sample Usage:
#
